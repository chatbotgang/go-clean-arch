# Go-Clean-Arch

**Go-Clean-Arch** gives a DDD-lite clean architecture template that is commonly used in Crescendo's Go projects. We will introduce the proposed architecture and related designs through a tutorial on building a sample application - **Crescendo Barter**.

## Overview

The proposed clean architecture is inspired by DDD (Domain-Driven Design), Uncle Bob's [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), and a Go Clean Architecture project [Wild Workouts](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example), trying to balance feature development speed and maintenance efforts.

Its eye-catching features include:
- **Layered architecture**: independent of frameworks and external systems.
- **Testable codebase**: workflows and business logic are well protected.
- **Ubiquitous language**: no barrier between business and engineering people.
- **Structured logs**: integrate third-party logging services easily.
- **First-class-citizen errors**: handle errors throughout the application in handy.
- **Product-ready code quality**: we implemented the sample application seriously.
- **Simple and straight**: new members could pick up the architecture within days.

## Architecture

![](./docs/clean-architecture-overview.png "architecture overview")

The proposed architecture can be separated into 4 layers, including `Router`, `Adapter`, `Application`, and `Domain`.
* `Router` handles input request things, such as HTTP request routing, authentication, access control, and parameter validation.
* `Adapter` handle output requests, such as accessing DB, communicate with other services, emit events.
* `Application` handles use cases (orchestration of business rules), compositing functionalities of `Domain` and `Adapter`.
* `Domain` handle business logic and domain models.

### Dependency Rules

## Crescendo Barter

Crescendo Barter is a second-hand goods exchange application in which people can post their old goods and exchange them with others.
