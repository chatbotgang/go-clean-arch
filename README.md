# Go-Clean-Arch

**Go-Clean-Arch** gives a Clean Architecture template that is commonly used in Crescendo's Go projects. We will introduce the proposed architecture and related designs through a tutorial on building a sample application - [Crescendo Barter](#crescendo-barter).

## Overview

The proposed clean architecture is inspired by DDD (Domain-Driven Design), Uncle Bob's [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), and a Go Clean Architecture project [Wild Workouts](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example), trying to balance feature development speed and maintenance efforts.

## Features

Our proposed clean architecture tries to provide the following features:
- **Testable**. Critical logic is well protected and validated.
- **Ubiquitous language**. No communication barrier between business and engineering people.
- **First-class-citizen errors**. Handle errors throughout the application in handy.
- **Traceable requests**. Internal behaviors of a request could be observed through API and system logs.
- **Product-ready**. Teams could use the architecture template in their new projects directly.
- **Simple and straight**. Any new member could pick up the architecture within days.

## Architecture

![](./docs/clean-architecture-overview.png "architecture overview")

The proposed architecture can be separated into 4 layers, including `Domain`, `Application`, `Router`, and `Adapter`.
- `Domain` handles domain models and critical business logic.
- `Application` handles use cases (orchestration of business rules), compositing functionalities of `Domain` and `Adapter`.
- `Router` handles input request things, such as HTTP request routing, authentication, access control, and parameter validation.
- `Adapter` handle output requests, such as accessing DB, communicate with other services, emit events.

Its dependency rules are:
